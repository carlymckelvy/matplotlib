Observations:

The data indicates that there were more mice treated with Ramicane and Capomulin than all other drug treatments.  Tumor sizes
at the end of the experiment were smaller for those mice treated with Ramicane and Capomulin.  The data also suggests that
tumor size tends to be larger in mice with higher weight.
